# ReactTodosApp

This is a weather application built on React. It was built from "The Complete React Web Developer Course" by udemy.com's Andrew Mead.

### Here are some of the tools I used: 
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) - I used React for the JavaScript framework.
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) - I used Foundation for CSS styling to make this app look nice.
  * [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) - I used Karma for testing the TodosApp.
